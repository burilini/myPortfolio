I loved this exercise!

This exercise was put in our path to learn and demonstrate animation, movement, and create visual chaos.  As a side note, graphically I rarely approve of the visual "over-doing" it.  But in this case it was the most movement to date for me to code and gave me a great sense of accomplishment.
To execute: press ADD PACMAN  - press START GAME ; You can add as many of the PacMen as you like by pressing the ADD PACMAN button.  You can add before and after starting the game.

In the future, I am going to add more images of pacmen in different colors and/or styles.  I would also like to regulate different speeds for them.  I have a grandson that loves this!
