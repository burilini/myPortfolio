I loved this exercise!

This exercise was put in our path to learn and demonstrate animation, movement, and create visual chaos.  As I side note, graphically I rarely approve of the visual "over-doing" it.  But in this case it was the most movement to date for me to code and gave me a great sense of accomplishment.
