eyes project
This was my first interactive graphic that followed a user action.  You can see by the animation that the eyes follow the mouse.  I also was able to play around with the size of the features and colors as I manipulated the CSS-sstyles.  I am familiar and have experience in the manipulation of graphic and color as a designer, but the UI was new for me.  #creepyEyes
